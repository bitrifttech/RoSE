# Multi-Agent System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines a step-by-step implementation plan for creating a multi-agent system for superior code and documentation generation using LangGraph. The system will consist of specialized agents working together to produce high-quality software, with each agent focusing on a specific aspect of the development process.

The implementation will follow an incremental approach, adding and testing one agent at a time to ensure stability and proper functionality before moving to the next step.

## System Architecture

The multi-agent system will be built on top of the existing single-agent architecture, leveraging LangGraph's capabilities for state management, conditional routing, and agent coordination.

### Key Components

1. **Shared State**: A TypedDict containing all necessary information for agents to collaborate
2. **Specialized Agents**: Individual agents with specific roles and responsibilities
3. **Routing Logic**: Conditional edges to direct workflow based on the current state
4. **Shared Memory**: Mechanism for agents to access and update shared information

## LangGraph Implementation Context

From the LangGraph documentation, we'll be using the following key concepts:

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from typing import TypedDict, Annotated, Sequence, Union, List, Dict, Any, Literal, Optional
import operator
import logging
import json
```

For state management:

```python
class ProjectState(TypedDict, total=False):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, ToolMessage]], operator.add]
    chat_history: Annotated[List[Dict[str, str]], operator.add]
    pending_response: Optional[AIMessage]
    session_id: str
    # Multi-agent specific fields
    requirements: List[Dict[str, str]]
    architecture_decisions: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    code_components: Dict[str, str]
    test_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    documentation: Dict[str, str]
    current_phase: str
```

For conditional routing:

```python
def route(state: ProjectState) -> str:
    # Determine which agent should process the current state
    current_phase = state.get("current_phase", "requirements")
    
    # Logic to determine the next agent
    if condition:
        return "agent_name"
    return "default_agent"

graph.add_conditional_edges(
    "router",
    route,
    {
        "agent1": "agent1",
        "agent2": "agent2",
        # More agents...
        END: END
    }
)
```

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Refactor Current Single-Agent System

**Goal**: Prepare the existing system for multi-agent extension

**Tasks**:
1. Refactor the current `AgentState` to include fields needed for multi-agent collaboration
2. Update the existing agent to work within the new state structure
3. Create a basic router node that will later direct flow between agents

**Implementation**:

```python
# Enhanced state for multi-agent support
class ProjectState(TypedDict, total=False):
    messages: Annotated[Sequence[Union[HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, ToolMessage]], operator.add]
    chat_history: Annotated[List[Dict[str, str]], operator.add]
    pending_response: Optional[AIMessage]
    session_id: str
    # New fields for multi-agent specialization
    requirements: List[Dict[str, str]]
    architecture_decisions: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    code_components: Dict[str, str]
    test_results: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    documentation: Dict[str, str]
    current_phase: str
```

**Testing**:
- Ensure the existing functionality works with the new state structure
- Verify that the router correctly handles the current single-agent flow

            # Mark the current phase as complete
            state["current_phase"] = "implementation"
        
        return state
```

**Router Update**:

    code_feedback: List[Dict[str, str]]
    test_feedback: List[Dict[str, str]]
    documentation_feedback: List[Dict[str, str]]
```

**Example Feedback Loop**:

    """Process feedback and update the state accordingly."""
    # Check for QA feedback on code
    if state.get("test_results") and has_issues(state["test_results"]):
        # Extract specific feedback for the code engineer

            state["code_feedback"] = []
        state["code_feedback"].extend(code_feedback)
        
        # Set the phase to implementation to address the feedback
        state["current_phase"] = "implementation"

    def write_context(self, key: str, value: Any) -> None:
        """Write a value to the shared context."""
        self.memory[key] = value
    
    def add_artifact(self, name: str, content: str, artifact_type: str) -> None:

            if key != "messages" and key != "chat_history":
                self.shared_memory.write_context(key, value)
        
        # Run the graph
        result = self.graph.invoke(state)
        
        # Update the shared memory with the final state
        for key, value in result.items():

                self.shared_memory.write_context(key, value)

**Testing**:
- Test the shared memory system with multiple agents
- Verify that agents can access and update shared information
- Ensure the memory correctly persists across agent invocations

### Step 9: Implement Advanced Routing and Error Handling

**Goal**: Enhance the system with advanced routing and robust error handling

**Tasks**:

```python
def error_handler(state: ProjectState) -> ProjectState:
    """Handle errors in the workflow."""
    error_logs = state.get("error_logs", [])
    
    if not error_logs:
        return state
    
    # Process each error
    resolved_errors = []
    for error in error_logs:
        # Logic to handle the error
        resolution = handle_error(error)
        resolved_errors.append({
            "error": error,
            "resolution": resolution
        })
    
    # Update the state
    state["error_resolutions"] = resolved_errors
    state["error_logs"] = []  # Clear the errors
    
    return state
```

**Testing**:
- Test the advanced routing with various state configurations
- Verify that errors are correctly handled and resolved
- Ensure the system can recover from error states

### Step 10: Final Integration and End-to-End Testing

**Goal**: Integrate all components and perform comprehensive testing

**Tasks**:
1. Finalize the multi-agent graph
2. Create comprehensive test scenarios
3. Perform end-to-end testing
4. Document the system behavior and performance

**Implementation**:

```python
# Final multi-agent system
multi_agent_system = MultiAgentSystem(llm_config=DEFAULT_CONFIG)

# Test with a complete project scenario
initial_state = {
    "messages": [
        HumanMessage(content="Create a web application for tracking daily tasks with user authentication, task creation, completion tracking, and reminder notifications.")
    ],
    "session_id": "test-session",
    "current_phase": "requirements"
}

result = multi_agent_system.run(initial_state)

# Analyze the results
print("Final Phase:", result.get("current_phase"))
print("Architecture Decisions:", len(result.get("architecture_decisions", [])))
print("Code Components:", len(result.get("code_components", {})))
print("Test Results:", len(result.get("test_results", [])))
print("Documentation:", len(result.get("documentation", {})))
```

**Testing**:
- Perform end-to-end testing with complex project requirements
- Verify that all agents work together seamlessly
- Ensure the final output meets quality standards

## Conclusion

This implementation plan provides a step-by-step approach to building a multi-agent system for code and documentation generation. By following this incremental approach, we can ensure that each component is properly tested and integrated before moving to the next step.

The final system will leverage LangGraph's capabilities for state management, conditional routing, and agent coordination to create a powerful and flexible multi-agent workflow that can handle complex software development tasks.
