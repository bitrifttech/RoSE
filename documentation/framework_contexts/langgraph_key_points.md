Direct Answer
Introduction
This document is designed to help an LLM reliably modify and generate Python LangGraph software by providing all necessary information. LangGraph, part of the LangChain ecosystem, builds complex workflows with LLMs and tools, perfect for multi-agent systems.
Setup and Basics
Install LangGraph with pip install langgraph langchain and import StateGraph and END. Create a basic graph with a node, like printing messages, to get started:
python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict, Sequence, Union

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Sequence[Union[str, dict]]

def print_messages(state: State) -> State:
    print(state["messages"])
    return state

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("print", print_messages)
graph.set_entry_point("print")
compiled_graph = graph.compile()
initial_state = {"messages": ["Hello, world!"]}
result = compiled_graph.invoke(initial_state)
Learn more at the LangGraph Getting Started Guide.
Nodes and Tools
Define nodes for LLMs and tools. An LLM node calls the model and updates state:
python
def call_llm(state: State) -> State:
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm(messages)
    state["messages"].append(response)
    return state
A tool node executes external functions, like:
python
class MyTool(BaseTool):
    name = "my_tool"
    description = "Does something useful."

    def _run(self, input: str) -> str:
        return f"Tool output for {input}"

def use_tool(state: State) -> State:
    input_for_tool = "some input"
    tool = MyTool()
    result = tool._run(input_for_tool)
    state["messages"].append({"role": "tool", "content": result})
    return state
State and Messages
State is a dictionary with keys like messages and chat_history. Update it carefully to avoid conflicts:
python
def update_state(state: State) -> State:
    new_state = state.copy()
    new_state["new_key"] = "new_value"
    return new_state
Messages include HumanMessage, AIMessage, SystemMessage, and ToolMessage for context.
Multi-Agent Systems with Examples
For complex multi-agent systems, create agents like planning and coding. Example:
python
def plan_agent(state: State) -> State:
    # Generate plan, e.g., "Plan: Implement login feature"
    state["task_plan"] = "Implement login feature"
    return state

def code_agent(state: State) -> State:
    # Implement based on plan
    if state.get("task_plan"):
        state["code_implementation"] = [{"code": "def login(): pass"}]
    return state

graph.add_node("plan", plan_agent)
graph.add_node("code", code_agent)
graph.add_edge("plan", "code")
graph.set_entry_point("plan")
compiled_graph = graph.compile()
initial_state = {"messages": [HumanMessage(content="Create a login feature")]}
result = compiled_graph.invoke(initial_state)
Route dynamically with conditions:
python
def route(state: State) -> str:
    if not state.get("task_plan"):
        return "plan"
    return "code"

graph.add_conditional_edges("router", route, {"plan": "plan", "code": "code"})
Debugging and Logging
Use logging to track state changes:
python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)

def debug_node(state: State) -> State:
    logging.debug(f"Current state: {state}")
    return state
This helps identify issues, surprisingly crucial for reliable modifications.
Advanced Topics
Handle asynchronous operations with async/await, manage errors with try-except, and optimize performance by minimizing state updates.
Comprehensive LangGraph Documentation for LLM Context
Introduction
LangGraph, a component of the LangChain ecosystem, is designed for constructing and managing intricate workflows that integrate large language models (LLMs) and various tools. It uses a graph-based approach where nodes represent functions like LLM calls, tool executions, or custom logic, and edges define the flow between these nodes based on specific conditions. This makes it ideal for creating modular workflows, managing state, implementing conditional routing, and integrating external tools, which are especially useful in multi-agent systems and dynamic task handling.
The primary benefits of using LangGraph include:
Modular Workflows: Decomposing complex tasks into smaller, manageable components, each handled by specialized nodes.
State Management: Preserving and updating the workflow state to maintain context across nodes, ensuring continuity.
Conditional Flow: Dynamically routing the workflow based on the current state for flexible decision-making, adapting to task requirements.
Tool Integration: Seamlessly incorporating external tools and services to enhance workflow capabilities, extending functionality beyond LLMs.
To begin utilizing LangGraph, one must first install the necessary packages and import the required modules. The installation process involves using pip, followed by importing key components from the LangGraph and LangChain libraries.
Setting Up a Basic StateGraph
To initiate a LangGraph project, install the required packages using the following command:
bash
pip install langgraph langchain
Subsequently, import the necessary modules:
python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain_core.runnables import LLM, PromptTemplate, Tool, BaseTool
A fundamental StateGraph can be established with a single node that processes the state. For instance, consider a node that outputs the current messages:
python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph
from typing import TypedDict, Sequence, Union

class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Sequence[Union[str, dict]]

def print_messages(state: State) -> State:
    print(state["messages"])
    return state

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("print", print_messages)
graph.set_entry_point("print")
compiled_graph = graph.compile()

# Execute the graph with an initial state
initial_state = {"messages": ["Hello, world!"]}
result = compiled_graph.invoke(initial_state)
This example demonstrates a basic workflow where the state contains a "messages" key, a list of strings or dictionaries, and the node "print" displays these messages without modifying the state, serving as a starting point for more complex graphs.
Defining Nodes
Nodes in LangGraph are callable functions that accept the current state and return an updated state. They can encompass LLM calls, tool executions, or custom logic, providing flexibility in workflow design.
LLM Nodes
To integrate an LLM into a node, define a function that invokes the LLM and updates the state with the response. An example is as follows:
python
from langchain_core.runnables import LLM

# Assume llm is an instance of LLM
def call_llm(state: State) -> State:
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm(messages)
    state["messages"].append(response)
    return state
This node retrieves the current messages, calls the LLM, and appends the response to the state, maintaining the conversation context for subsequent nodes, ensuring continuity in multi-turn interactions.
Tool Nodes
Tools can be incorporated similarly, with nodes that execute tools and update the state with the results. Consider the following example:
python
from langchain_core.runnables import BaseTool

class MyTool(BaseTool):
    name = "my_tool"
    description = "Does something useful."

    def _run(self, input: str) -> str:
        return f"Tool output for {input}"

def use_tool(state: State) -> State:
    # Assume logic to determine tool usage
    input_for_tool = "some input"
    tool = MyTool()
    result = tool._run(input_for_tool)
    state["messages"].append({"role": "tool", "content": result})
    return state
This node uses a tool, executes it with specified input, and adds the result to the messages, enabling the workflow to leverage external functionality, enhancing its capabilities beyond LLM responses.
Managing State
The state, a persistent dictionary across node executions, is vital for maintaining context and flow. It typically includes keys such as "messages," "chat_history," and custom fields for multi-agent systems, ensuring all components have access to necessary information.
Common State Keys
messages: A list of messages, each potentially a string or dictionary with "role" and "content" keys, facilitating communication between nodes and LLMs, central to conversation context.
chat_history: A list storing the entire conversation history, essential for maintaining context across multiple interactions, supporting long-running workflows.
pending_response: Used to manage tool calls or asynchronous tasks, ensuring proper sequencing in the workflow, crucial for handling external integrations.
Best Practices for Updating State
When updating the state, return a new dictionary to avoid conflicts, especially with keys like "pending_response" that may cause concurrent update errors. An example is:
python
def update_state(state: State) -> State:
    new_state = state.copy()
    new_state["new_key"] = "new_value"
    return new_state
This approach copies the existing state and adds a new key, a common pattern to ensure state integrity, preventing unintended overwrites and maintaining workflow reliability.
Messages and Chat History
Messages are central to LangGraph, providing context to LLMs and other nodes, and are typically stored in the state under "messages" or "chat_history," ensuring continuity in the conversation.
Message Types
LangGraph supports several message types to represent different roles:
HumanMessage: Represents user-initiated messages, often the starting point of a workflow, capturing user intent.
AIMessage: Contains responses from the LLM, updating the conversation, reflecting the model's output.
SystemMessage: Provides instructions or context for the LLM, setting the tone or constraints, guiding behavior.
ToolMessage: Holds results from tool calls, integrating external functionality into the workflow, enhancing capabilities.
Maintaining Conversation Context
Consider an initial state with a user query:
python
from langchain_core.messages import HumanMessage, AIMessage

initial_state = {
    "messages": [
        HumanMessage(content="What is the capital of France?")
    ]
}
After processing by an LLM node, the state might update to:
python
{
    "messages": [
        HumanMessage(content="What is the capital of France?"),
        AIMessage(content="Paris")
    ]
}
This maintains the conversation context, crucial for multi-turn interactions and task progression, ensuring the workflow can handle complex dialogues.
Conditional Flow and Routing
LangGraph enables dynamic routing through conditional edges, allowing the workflow to branch based on the current state, adapting to task requirements.
Defining Condition Functions
Define a routing function that determines the next node based on the state:
python
def should_continue(state: State) -> str:
    if state.get("some_condition", False):
        return "next_node"
    else:
        return END
Adding Conditional Edges
Add conditional edges to the graph to implement the routing:
python
graph.add_conditional_edges("current_node", should_continue, {"next_node": "next_node", END: END})
This example routes to "next_node" if "some_condition" is true, otherwise ends the workflow, providing flexibility in workflow design, crucial for dynamic task handling.
Multi-Agent Systems with Examples
LangGraph excels in multi-agent systems, where different agents collaborate via their nodes, each handling specific tasks. For complex systems, design graphs with multiple agents, routing based on state conditions.
Designing a Multi-Agent System
Consider a system with a planning agent and a coding agent:
python
def plan_agent(state: State) -> State:
    # Generate and evaluate plans
    state["task_plan"] = "Implement login feature with OAuth"
    return state

def code_agent(state: State) -> State:
    # Implement based on plan
    if state.get("task_plan"):
        state["code_implementation"] = [{"code": "def login_with_oauth(): pass"}]
    return state

def test_agent(state: State) -> State:
    # Test the implementation
    if state.get("code_implementation"):
        state["test_results"] = [{"result": "Tests passed"}]
    return state

graph = StateGraph(State)
graph.add_node("plan", plan_agent)
graph.add_node("code", code_agent)
graph.add_node("test", test_agent)
graph.add_edge("plan", "code")
graph.add_edge("code", "test")
graph.set_entry_point("plan")
compiled_graph = graph.compile()
Routing in Multi-Agent Systems
Use conditional edges for dynamic routing:
python
def route(state: State) -> str:
    if not state.get("task_plan"):
        return "plan"
    elif not state.get("code_implementation"):
        return "code"
    elif not state.get("test_results"):
        return "test"
    return END

graph.add_conditional_edges("router", route, {"plan": "plan", "code": "code", "test": "test", END: END})
This example shows a sequential flow: plan, code, test, with routing based on state completeness, ensuring each agent completes its task before moving forward.
Example: Complex Multi-Agent System
For a more complex system, include error handling and tool integration:
python
class ErrorHandlerAgent(BaseAgent):
    def process(self, state: State) -> State:
        if state.get("error_logs"):
            state["error_resolution"] = "Resolved errors"
        return state

graph.add_node("error_handler", ErrorHandlerAgent().process)
graph.add_conditional_edges("code", lambda s: "error_handler" if s.get("error_logs") else "test", 
                          {"error_handler": "error_handler", "test": "test"})
This adds an error handler that activates if errors are logged, demonstrating conditional branching in a multi-agent setup.
Tool Integration
Tools enhance LangGraph workflows by executing specific tasks. LLMs can call tools, and nodes handle the results, integrating external functionality.
Defining and Using Tools
Define a tool and pass it to the LLM node:
python
from langchain_core.runnables import Tool

class ExecuteCommandTool(Tool):
    name = "execute_command"
    description = "Executes a shell command."

    def _run(self, command: str) -> str:
        # Execute the command and return the result
        pass

tools = [ExecuteCommandTool()]

def call_llm_with_tools(state: State) -> State:
    messages = state["messages"]
    response = llm(messages, tools=tools)
    state["messages"].append(response)
    return state
This integrates tools seamlessly, allowing the LLM to invoke them as needed, enhancing workflow capabilities.
Debugging and Logging
Debugging LangGraph workflows involves tracking state changes and flow. Use logging to monitor the process, crucial for ensuring reliable modifications.
Implementing Logging
Use Python's logging module to track the flow:
python
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def debug_node(state: State) -> State:
    logger.debug(f"Current state: {state}")
    return state

graph.add_node("debug", debug_node)
graph.add_edge("some_node", "debug")
This helps monitor the workflow, identify issues like state conflicts or incorrect routing, and ensure correct state transitions, surprisingly important for reliability.
Advanced Topics
For advanced usage, consider:
Asynchronous Operations: Handle concurrent tasks using async/await for better performance, crucial for scalable workflows.
Error Handling: Implement try-except blocks in nodes to manage failures gracefully, ensuring robustness.
Performance Optimization: Optimize graph execution by minimizing state updates and using efficient routing logic, enhancing efficiency.
These topics enhance the robustness and efficiency of LangGraph workflows, crucial for complex applications and reliable modifications by the LLM.
