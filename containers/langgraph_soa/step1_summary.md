# Step 1: Refactor Current Single-Agent System - Summary

## Completed Tasks

1. **Refactored State Structure**
   - Created a new `ProjectState` class with fields needed for multi-agent collaboration
   - Added fields for requirements, architecture decisions, code components, test results, documentation
   - Added fields for feedback loops and error handling
   - Maintained backward compatibility with `AgentState`

2. **Updated Agent Implementation**
   - Modified the existing agent to work with the new state structure
   - Updated type hints and function signatures to use `ProjectState`
   - Ensured all agent methods properly handle the new state fields

3. **Created Basic Router Node**
   - Implemented a router node that will direct flow between agents
   - Added phase-based routing logic (to be expanded in later steps)
   - Set up the foundation for conditional routing based on the current phase

4. **Enhanced Environment Management**
   - Created an environment loader utility to load API keys from .env files
   - Updated LLM implementations to use the environment loader
   - Added fallback to mock keys for testing purposes

5. **Improved Testing Infrastructure**
   - Created a mock LLM implementation for testing without API keys
   - Developed a test script to verify the refactored system
   - Successfully tested the basic functionality with the new state structure

## Next Steps

The next step (Step 2) will be to implement the System Architect Agent, which will be responsible for:
1. Designing system architecture and components
2. Creating technical specifications
3. Ensuring scalability and performance
4. Managing technical debt
5. Documenting architectural decisions
6. Evaluating technical trade-offs

This agent will be the first specialized agent in our multi-agent system and will handle the "requirements" phase of the workflow.
