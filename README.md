## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20.x or later
- [OpenAI API key](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys) for AI features

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RoSE.git
   cd RoSE
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   Edit the `.env` file and add your OpenAI API key:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   chmod +x init-db.sh
   ./init-db.sh
   ```

4. **Build and start the containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```

5. **Access the application**
   
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   - Main UI: [http://localhost:8090](http://localhost:8090)

## Detailed Installation Guide

### System Requirements

- **Operating System**: Windows, macOS, or Linux
- **CPU**: 4+ cores recommended
- **RAM**: 8GB minimum, 16GB+ recommended
- **Storage**: 10GB+ free space
- **Docker**: Latest stable version
- **Node.js**: v20.x or later
- **Internet Connection**: Required for AI features and container image downloads

### Step-by-Step Installation

1. **Install Docker and Docker Compose**
   
   Follow the official installation guides:
   - [Docker Desktop for Windows/Mac](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
   - [Docker Engine for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
   - [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

2. **Install Node.js**
   
   Download and install from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/) or use a version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

3. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/RoSE.git
   cd RoSE
   ```

4. **Configure environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
   
   Edit the `.env` file with your preferred text editor and add:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Initialize the database**
   ```bash
   chmod +x init-db.sh
   ./init-db.sh
   ```
   
   This script will:
   - Create a default .env file if none exists
   - Start the PostgreSQL container
   - Wait for PostgreSQL to be ready
   - Start the container orchestrator
   - Run all database migrations

6. **Build and start all containers**
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build
   ```
   
   For headless/background mode:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

7. **Verify installation**
   
   Check that all services are running:
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   ```
   
   You should see all containers in the "Up" state.

## Architecture Overview

RoSE consists of several Docker containers that work together:

### Main Components

1. **UX (Frontend)**
   - React/Vite application with modern UI components
   - Provides interface for file management, terminal access, and AI interactions
   - Port: 8090

2. **Dev Container**
   - Provides file operations and terminal access
   - Handles server operations and file management
   - Ports: 8010-8040 for various services

3. **Container Orchestrator**
   - Manages container lifecycle and operations
   - Handles API requests and container management
   - Port: 8000

4. **LangGraph SOA**
   - AI service using LangGraph for advanced language processing
   - Provides conversational AI capabilities
   - Port: 8100

5. **PostgreSQL Database**
   - Stores project data, user information, and system settings
   - Managed through Prisma ORM

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Containers Won't Start
```bash
# Check for port conflicts
netstat -tuln

# Check container logs
docker compose logs

# Restart all containers
docker compose down
docker compose up
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Check database logs
docker compose logs postgres

# Reinitialize the database
docker compose down -v
./init-db.sh
```

#### AI Features Not Working
- Verify your OpenAI API key in the `.env` file
- Check the LangGraph service logs:
  ```bash
  docker compose logs langgraph_soa
  ```
- Ensure you have sufficient API credits

#### Performance Issues
- Increase Docker resource allocation (CPU/Memory)
- Close unnecessary applications
- Check system resource usage during operation

## Development and Customization

### Modifying the Frontend
```bash
# Edit files in containers/ux_container/src
# Restart the UX container
docker compose restart ux
```

### Customizing AI Behavior
```bash
# Edit files in containers/langgraph_soa
# Restart the LangGraph container
docker compose restart langgraph_soa
```

### Adding New Features
- Frontend components: `containers/ux_container/src/components`
- Backend services: Respective container directories
- Database schema: `containers/container_orchestrator/prisma/schema.prisma`
